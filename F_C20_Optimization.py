'''
Functions necessary for the rotation of detected beads
and its elongation/compression optimization.
As explained in our paper of BeadBuddy, we do this to find 
a major axis of elongation/compression.
Not strictly necessary for the Spherical Harmonincs analysis
In some cases, it can be overridden by ignoring the rotations
