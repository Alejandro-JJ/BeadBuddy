BeadBuddy offers an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed in python for the analysis of fluorescent force sensors inside biological tissue. It offers a combination of:

* Powerful segmentation based on the GPU-accelerated capabilities of py-clesperanto

* Fast spherical harmonics expansion based on pyshtools

* Pre-computed analytical solutions to the elastic problem as published in Kr√ºger et al., Biophysical Journal (2024)

The main function is the PyQt5 environment BeadBuddy.py, which can be called from the console in the root directory 
```
python BeadBuddy.py
```
